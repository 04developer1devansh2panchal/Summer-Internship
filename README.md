# Summer-Internship
# ðŸš¦ Smart Traffic Monitoring and Maintaining System using AI  

This repository contains the work I did during my **Summer Internship 2025** at the **Department of AI & ML, CSPIT, CHARUSAT**.  
The project focuses on building an **AI-powered traffic monitoring system** using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** techniques to detect vehicles, monitor traffic flow, and improve traffic management.  

---

##  Project Overview  
Traffic congestion is a major issue in urban areas. Traditional traffic lights operate on fixed timers, which often leads to delays and inefficiency.  
The aim of this project is to use **AI & Computer Vision** for:  
- Real-time **vehicle detection and tracking**  
- Identifying **emergency vehicles** like ambulances/fire trucks  
- Providing inputs for **dynamic traffic light control**  

---

##  Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (initial experiments using [WEKA](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/))  
- **Python Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib  
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch / YOLOv5  
- **Datasets:**  
  - Iris dataset (for ML practice)  
  - Image & Video datasets (for vehicle detection)  
  - Custom dataset (for emergency vehicles)

##  Project Workflow  
1. **Learning Phase**  
   - Studied Machine Learning concepts & algorithms  
   - Experimented on the **Iris dataset** using WEKA  

2. **Research Phase**  
   - Reviewed multiple research papers on traffic monitoring systems  
   - Created a **synopsis** for the project idea  

3. **Implementation Phase**  
   - Worked with CSV, image, and video datasets  
   - Implemented **YOLOv5** for vehicle detection  
   - Generated a **demo video** for object detection  

4. **Fine-Tuning Phase**  
   - Added detection for **emergency vehicles** by fine-tuning YOLO on a **custom dataset**

##  Future Scope  
- Integration with **IoT-based traffic light systems** for real-time synchronization  
- Deploying the system on **Jetson Nano / Edge Devices** for on-site processing  
- Expanding the dataset for more vehicle categories
